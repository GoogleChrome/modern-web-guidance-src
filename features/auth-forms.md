# Authentication Forms

## Own Form Element { #auth-own-form }

Always use the `<form>` element when you're getting users to enter data.

Don't wrap inputs in a `<div>` and handle input data submission purely with JavaScript. It's generally better to use a `<form>` element. This makes your site accessible to screenreaders and other assistive devices, enables a range of built-in browser features, makes it simpler to build basic functional authentication for older browsers, and can still work even if JavaScript fails.

## Don't Double Up Inputs { #auth-dont-double-up }

Some sites force users to enter emails or passwords twice. That might reduce errors for a few users, but causes extra work for all users, and increases abandonment rates. Asking twice also makes no sense where browsers autofill email addresses or suggest strong passwords. It's better to enable users to confirm their email address (you'll need to do that anyway) and make it easy for them to reset their password if necessary.

## Password Privacy & Show Password { #auth-keep-passwords-private }

Passwords inputs should have `type="password"` to hide password text and help the browser understand that the input is for passwords. (Note that browsers use a variety of techniques to understand input roles and decide whether or not to offer to save passwords.)

You should add a **Show password** toggle to enable users to check the text they've entered—and don't forget to add a **Forgot password** link.

## Mobile Keyboards { #auth-mobile-keyboard }

Use `<input type="email">` to give mobile users an appropriate keyboard and enable basic built-in email address validation by the browser… no JavaScript required!

If you need to use a telephone number instead of an email address, `<input type="tel">` enables a telephone keypad on mobile. You can also use the `inputmode` attribute where necessary: `inputmode="numeric"` is ideal for PIN numbers.

## Re-entering Credentials { #auth-avoid-re-entering }

You can help browsers store data correctly and autofill inputs, so users don't have to remember to enter email and password values. This is particularly important on mobile, and crucial for email inputs, which get high abandonment rates. There are two parts to this:

1. The `autocomplete`, `name`, `id`, and `type` attributes help browsers understand the role of inputs in order to store data that can later be used for autofill. To allow data to be stored for autofill, modern browsers also require inputs to have a stable `name` or `id` value (not randomly generated on each page load or site deployment), and to be in a `<form>` element with a `submit` button.
2. The `autocomplete` attribute helps browsers correctly autofill inputs using stored data.

For email inputs use `autocomplete="username"`, since `username` is recognized by password managers in modern browsers—even though you should use `type="email"` and you may want to use `id="email"` and `name="email"`. For password inputs, use the appropriate `autocomplete` and `id` values to help browsers differentiate between new and current passwords.

## Suggest Strong Password { #auth-suggest-strong-password }

Modern browsers use heuristics to decide when to show the password manager UI and suggest a strong password.

Built-in browser password generators mean users and developers don't need to work out what a "strong password" is. Since browsers can securely store passwords and autofill them as necessary, there's no need for users to remember or enter passwords. Encouraging users to take advantage of built-in browser password generators also means they're more likely to use a unique, strong password on your site, and less likely to reuse a password that could be compromised elsewhere.

## Allow Password Pasting { #auth-allow-password-pasting }

Some sites don't allow text to be pasted into password inputs.

Disallowing password pasting annoys users, encourages passwords that are memorable (and therefore may be easier to compromise) and, according to organizations such as the UK National Cyber Security Centre, may actually reduce security. Users only become aware that pasting is disallowed after they try to paste their password, so disallowing password pasting doesn't avoid clipboard vulnerabilities.

Note that modern browsers actively ignore `onpaste="return false"` overrides on password fields to protect users against these exact security anti-patterns.

## Registration Form Security and Layout { #auth-registration-practices }

### Put sign-up in its own <form> element

Always use the `<form>` element when you're getting users to enter data.

Don't wrap inputs in a `<div>` and handle input data submission purely with JavaScript. It's generally better to use a `<form>` element. This makes your site accessible to screenreaders and other assistive devices, enables a range of built-in browser features, makes it simpler to build basic functional authentication for older browsers, and can still work even if JavaScript fails.

It's better to enable users to confirm their email address (you'll need to do that anyway) and make it easy for them to reset their password if necessary.

### Keep passwords private—but enable users to see them if they want

Passwords inputs should have `type="password"` to hide password text and help the browser understand that the input is for passwords. (Note that browsers use a variety of techniques to understand input roles and decide whether or not to offer to save passwords.)

You should add a **Show password** toggle to enable users to check the text they've entered—and don't forget to add a **Forgot password** link.

### Give mobile users the right keyboard
