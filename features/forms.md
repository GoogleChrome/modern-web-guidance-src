# Forms

## Meaningful HTML { #forms-meaningful-html }

Make the most of the elements and attributes built for creating forms:

- `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<button>`
- `type`, `autocomplete`, and `inputmode`

These enable built-in browser functionality, improve accessibility, and add meaning to markup.

## Label Element { #forms-label-element }

To label an `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>`, use a `<label>`. Associate a label with an input by giving the label's `for` attribute the same value as the input's `id`.

## HTML Attributes - Intro { #forms-html-attributes-intro }

Make it easy for users to enter data, by using the appropriate `<input>` element `<type>` attribute to provide the right keyboard on mobile and enable basic built-in validation by the browser.

Always use `type="email"` for email addresses and `type="tel"` for phone numbers.

## HTML Attributes - Conclusion { #forms-html-attributes-conclusion }

Every `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` element SHOULD have an appropriate `autocomplete` attribute, to improve accessibility and help users avoid re-entering data.

## Buttons { #forms-button-element }

Use `<button>` for buttons. You can also use `<input type="submit">`, but don't use a `div` or some other random element acting as a button. Button elements provide accessible behaviour, built-in form submission functionality, and can easily be styled.

## Single Name Input { #forms-single-name }

Allow your users to enter their name using a single input, unless you have a good reason for separately storing given names, family names, honorifics, or other name parts. Using a single name input makes forms less complex, enables cut-and-paste, and makes autofill simpler.

Allow international names. For validation, avoid using regular expressions that only match Latin characters. Latin-only excludes users with names or addresses that include characters that aren't in the Latin alphabet. Allow Unicode letter matching instead—and ensure your backend supports Unicode securely as both input and output. Unicode in regular expressions is well supported by modern browsers.

## Enterkeyhint { #forms-enterkeyhint }

Use the `enterkeyhint` attribute on form inputs to set the mobile keyboard enter key label. For example, use `enterkeyhint="previous"` and `enterkeyhint="next"` within a multi-page form, `enterkeyhint="done"` for the final input in the form, and `enterkeyhint="search"` for a search input.
