# Export HTML content from canvas

Web applications frequently need to capture and export rich HTML content—such as customized dashboards, styled documents, or interactive charts—as static images or video recordings. Historically, achieving this required bulky third-party libraries that manually parse DOM nodes and CSS properties to reconstruct a visual facsimile on a canvas. This approach is computationally expensive, error-prone, and frequently fails to support modern CSS layout features. With the HTML-in-Canvas API, developers can render real DOM elements directly into the canvas context. Because the browser's native rendering engine paints the HTML subtree with pixel-perfect accuracy, capturing the exact visual output as an image or video stream is highly efficient using built-in canvas methods like `toDataURL()`, `toBlob()`, or `captureStream()`.

## How to implement

1. Check if HTML-in-Canvas is supported in the browser:

```
if ('requestPaint' in HTMLCanvasElement.prototype) {
  // Use HTML in Canvas API
} else {
  // Use fallback strategy
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> HTML-in-Canvas is supported from Chrome 157.

2. Initialize the canvas to support rendering of descendant HTML elements by adding the `content="drawable"` attribute to the `<canvas>` HTML element. Place your HTML content inside the `<canvas>` element, and add the `drawable` attribute to every element that you draw. An element with `drawable` captures its subtree, except nested descendants that are also `drawable`:

```html
<canvas id="canvas" content="drawable">
  <div id="html-content" drawable></div>
</canvas>
```

3. Scale your canvas grid to match the device scale factor to prevent blurriness:

```js
const observer = new ResizeObserver(([entry]) => {
  const dpc = entry.devicePixelContentBoxSize;
  canvas.width = dpc
    ? dpc[0].inlineSize
    : Math.round(entry.contentRect.width * window.devicePixelRatio);
  canvas.height = dpc
    ? dpc[0].blockSize
    : Math.round(entry.contentRect.height * window.devicePixelRatio);
});

const supportsDevicePixelContentBox =
  typeof ResizeObserverEntry !== "undefined" &&
  "devicePixelContentBoxSize" in ResizeObserverEntry.prototype;
const options = supportsDevicePixelContentBox
  ? { box: "device-pixel-content-box" }
  : {};
observer.observe(canvas, options);
```

4. Render the HTML content to the canvas inside a `canvas.onpaint` event handler. 
- In 2D context, use the `drawElementImage` method. It draws the last snapshot of a `drawable` element, and its drawable subtree (excluding other drawable children), starting at the element's border box, before CSS transforms:

```js
canvas.onpaint = () => {
  ctx.reset();
  // Draw the form element at x:0, y:0
  ctx.drawElementImage(form_element, 0, 0);
};
```

- In WebGL and WebGPU contexts, you copy the element into a texture. Size the texture from `canvas.captureElementImage(element)`. Its `width` and `height` are in canvas grid (backing store) pixels, so round them up with `Math.ceil()`. `captureElementImage()` throws if the element has no paint record yet: call `requestPaint()`, and retry on the next `paint` event.

```js
// Returns the element's size in canvas grid pixels, or null if the element
// has no paint record yet.
function getElementImageSize(canvas, element) {
  let elementImage;
  try {
    elementImage = canvas.captureElementImage(element);
  } catch (err) {
    canvas.requestPaint(); // No paint record yet: retry on the next paint event.
    return null;
  }
  const width = Math.ceil(elementImage.width);
  const height = Math.ceil(elementImage.height);
  elementImage.close();
  return width > 0 && height > 0 ? { width, height } : null;
}
```

- In WebGL context, pre-allocate the texture backing first using the `texImage2D` method. The snippets in this guide use a WebGL 2 context (`canvas.getContext("webgl2")`). Allocate texture storage by calling `texImage2D()` with `null` instead of pixel data, which reserves GPU memory of the given size and format without uploading any pixels. Follow these rules:
  - Size the texture from `captureElementImage()`, as shown above.
  - Allocate level 0 only on the first upload, or when the size changes, because reallocating clears the texture. Use mutable storage: immutable `texStorage2D()` storage can't be resized when the element changes size.

```js
// Binds the texture, and allocates its storage on the first upload, and when
// the element size changes. `state` stores the allocated size.
function allocateElementTexture(gl, texture, state, width, height) {
  gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture);
  if (state.width === width && state.height === height) return;

  gl.texImage2D(
    gl.TEXTURE_2D,
    0,                // Mipmap level
    gl.RGBA8,         // Internal format: 8 bits per RGBA channel
    width,            // Size in canvas grid pixels
    height,
    0,                // Border: must be 0
    gl.RGBA,          // Format and type that match RGBA8
    gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE,
    null              // null reserves GPU memory without uploading pixels
  );
  gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);
  state.width = width;
  state.height = height;
}

const texture = gl.createTexture();
const textureState = { width: 0, height: 0 };
```

- Then, in WebGL context, render the HTML content to the texture using the `texElementSubImage2D` method. Follow these rules:
  - Pass `{ width, height }` in the config. It makes the copy fill the allocated texture regardless of how the canvas is scaled.
  - Reallocate the texture if the size changed, as shown above.

```js
// Uploads the element into the texture. Returns false if the element has no
// paint record yet. In that case, it's uploaded on the next paint event.
function uploadElementWebGL(gl, canvas, texture, element, state) {
  const size = getElementImageSize(canvas, element);
  if (!size) return false;
  const { width, height } = size;

  // Bind the texture, and reallocate it if the size changed (see above).
  allocateElementTexture(gl, texture, state, width, height);
  gl.texElementSubImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, element, { width, height });
  return true;
}

canvas.onpaint = () => {
  try {
    uploadElementWebGL(gl, canvas, texture, uiElement, textureState);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('texElementSubImage2D copy failed:', err);
  }
};
```

- In WebGPU context, use the `drawElementImageToTexture` method. Follow these rules:
  - Create the texture with `COPY_DST` and `RENDER_ATTACHMENT` usage, and add `TEXTURE_BINDING` to sample it in shaders. A wrong usage is reported as a WebGPU validation error, not as an exception.
  - Pass the texture size as `size`. Without `size`, a larger element is clipped to the texture. With `size`, the element is scaled to fill it.
  - Recreate the texture when the element size changes, and rebuild the bind groups that reference it.

```js
// Create the texture once, and recreate it
// when the element size changes.
function ensureElementTexture(device, state, width, height) {
  if (state.texture?.width === width && state.texture?.height === height) {
    return state.texture;
  }
  state.texture?.destroy();
  state.texture = device.createTexture({
    size: { width, height },
    format: "rgba8unorm",
    usage:
      GPUTextureUsage.TEXTURE_BINDING |
      GPUTextureUsage.COPY_DST |
      GPUTextureUsage.RENDER_ATTACHMENT,
  });
  return state.texture; // Recreate the bind groups that used the previous texture.
}

const textureState = { texture: null };

canvas.onpaint = () => {
  const size = getElementImageSize(canvas, uiElement);
  if (!size) return;
  const previousTexture = textureState.texture;
  const texture = ensureElementTexture(device, textureState, size.width, size.height);
  if (texture !== previousTexture) {
    // New texture: create, or rebuild, the bind groups that reference it.
  }
  try {
    device.queue.drawElementImageToTexture({ source: uiElement }, { texture, size });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('drawElementImageToTexture copy failed:', err);
  }
};
```

When using a `requestAnimationFrame` loop to render the scene, call `canvas.requestPaint()` within the loop to ensure that the HTML content is rendered to the canvas. `event.changedElements` lists the elements whose rendering changed. Make sure you only redraw the element, or re-upload its texture, if there has been an update to the descendant HTML elements:

  ```js
  function render() {
    // Request to update the canvas
    canvas.requestPaint();
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(render);

  canvas.onpaint = (event) => {
    if (event.changedElements && event.changedElements.length > 0) {
      // Redraw the element, or update its texture, as shown above
    }
    // In WebGL and WebGPU, render the scene, and sync the element geometry as shown in step 5
  };
  ```

5. Sync the element geometry.

The browser needs to know where the HTML element is drawn, so that its DOM position matches its drawn pixels, for example, so that users can click and type into it. A canvas only hit tests the elements that are drawn with the 2D `drawElementImage()` method, or registered with `updateElementGeometry()`.

- For the 2D context case, the browser syncs the element automatically. `drawElementImage()` aligns the DOM hit-test bounds and screen reader focus rings with the drawn coordinates, so you don't need to set `style.transform`. To manage the geometry manually, for example, when you draw the same element more than once, pass `{ preserveElementGeometry: true }` to `drawElementImage()`, and apply transforms with `canvas.updateElementGeometry()`.

- For the 3D case with WebGL or WebGPU, the canvas can't tell where the HTML element is drawn, so you have to tell it. Compute a `DOMMatrix` that maps the element's border box, in CSS pixels, to the canvas, in CSS pixels. The browser needs to map from the 3D coordinate space into the CSS coordinate space using a viewport transform. To facilitate this, do the following:
  - Normalize the HTML element. HTML elements are sized in pixels (for example, 200px wide). WebGL, however, usually treats objects as "unit squares", for example, ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. If you don't normalize, your 200px button will look 200 times larger. This step also flips the Y-axis, because in CSS, down is positive, but in WebGL, up is positive.
  - Convert the WebGL MVP Matrix to a DOM Matrix.
  - Map to the canvas viewport. This step is the "re-scaling" phase: it stretches that unit-space math back out to match the CSS pixel dimensions of your `<canvas>` element on the screen, and flips the Y-axis back.
  - Calculate the final transform. Multiply the matrices in order: Viewport * MVP * Normalization. Combining them into one final transform produces a "map" that tells the browser exactly where that HTML element should sit to align with the 3D drawing. The browser performs the perspective divide.

  ```js
  // Maps the element's border box (CSS pixels) to the canvas (CSS pixels), for a
  // quad that spans -0.5 to 0.5 in model space and is drawn with the `mvp` matrix.
  function computeCanvasTransform(canvas, element, mvp) {
    const width = element.offsetWidth;
    const height = element.offsetHeight;

    // 1. Normalize the HTML element (CSS pixels -> WebGL Model Space)
    const toGLModel = new DOMMatrix()
      // Scale pixels to 1 unit, flip Y (as in CSS it points down, and in WebGL it points up)
      .scale(1 / width, -1 / height, 1 / height)
      // Center the origin: (0,0) becomes (-width/2, -height/2) before scaling
      .translate(-width / 2, -height / 2);

    // 2. Convert WebGL MVP Matrix to DOM Matrix
    const mvpDOM = new DOMMatrix(Array.from(mvp));

    // 3. Map to the canvas viewport, in CSS pixels
    const clipToCanvasViewport = new DOMMatrix()
      // Move center (0,0) to center of canvas
      .translate(canvas.clientWidth / 2, canvas.clientHeight / 2)
      // Scale normalized clip (-1..1) to viewport size, and flip Y back
      .scale(canvas.clientWidth / 2, -canvas.clientHeight / 2, canvas.clientHeight / 2);

    // 4. Multiply: (Clip -> Pixels) * (MVP) * (pixels -> unit square)
    return clipToCanvasViewport.multiply(mvpDOM).multiply(toGLModel);
  }
  ```

Then pass the transform to `canvas.updateElementGeometry()` as `canvasTransform`. This moves the HTML element to sit directly on top of its rendered pixels. This ensures that when a user clicks a button or selects text, they are actually hitting the real HTML element. The browser also uses the transform for the element's accessibility bounds, for example, for screen reader focus rings:

  ```js
  canvas.updateElementGeometry(targetHTMLElement, {
    canvasTransform: computeCanvasTransform(canvas, targetHTMLElement, htmlElementMVP),
  });
  ```

Use these options to control hit testing:
  - Each `updateElementGeometry()` call moves the element to the top of the hit-testing order. Pass `{ preserveHitTestOrder: true }` to keep its position.
  - Call `canvas.clearElementGeometry(element)` to remove an element from hit testing, for example, when you hide it.

6. Use regular canvas export methods like `toDataURL()`, `toBlob()`, or `captureStream()`. The exported data will include the rendered HTML content.

## Example code

```html
<body>
    <canvas id="canvas" style="width: 400px; height: 200px;" content="drawable">
        <input id="element" drawable>
    </canvas>
    
    <button id="download">Download Image</button>

    <script>
        const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        const element = document.getElementById('element');
        const download = document.getElementById('download');

        canvas.onpaint = (event) => {
            ctx.reset();
            // Draw the element into the canvas. The browser synchronizes its
            // DOM position for hit testing (typing).
            ctx.drawElementImage(element, 10, 10);
        };

        download.onclick = () => {
            // Export the canvas content as an image
            const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
            const link = document.createElement('a');
            link.download = 'exported-canvas.png';
            link.href = dataURL;
            link.click();
        };

        // Re-initialize canvas size on screen resize
        const observer = new ResizeObserver(([entry]) => {
            const dpc = entry.devicePixelContentBoxSize;
            canvas.width = dpc ? dpc[0].inlineSize : Math.round(entry.contentRect.width * window.devicePixelRatio);
            canvas.height = dpc ? dpc[0].blockSize : Math.round(entry.contentRect.height * window.devicePixelRatio);
            canvas.requestPaint();
        });
        const supportsDevicePixelContentBox = 
            typeof ResizeObserverEntry !== 'undefined' && 
            'devicePixelContentBoxSize' in ResizeObserverEntry.prototype;
        const options = supportsDevicePixelContentBox ? { box: 'device-pixel-content-box' } : {};
        observer.observe(canvas, options);
    </script>
</body>
```

## Best Practices

- **MANDATORY**: Check browser support for the HTML-in-Canvas API before using it.
- **MANDATORY**: Always add the `content="drawable"` attribute to the `<canvas>` element.
- **MANDATORY**: Add the `drawable` attribute to every element that you draw, including direct children of the canvas.
- **MANDATORY**: Use an `onpaint` event handler to render the HTML content to the canvas.
- **MANDATORY**: Use the `drawElementImage` method in 2D, or `drawElementImageToTexture` in WebGPU, to render the HTML content to the canvas.
- **MANDATORY**: In WebGL, pre-allocate the texture buffer with `texImage2D()` once (when it's initialized or when the element size changes). Reallocate the texture only when the size changes, and set `TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER` to `LINEAR`.
- **MANDATORY**: In WebGL, use the `texElementSubImage2D` method to render the HTML content to a texture that you pre-allocate with `texImage2D()`, sized from `captureElementImage()`.
- **MANDATORY**: In WebGPU, size the texture from `captureElementImage()`, and recreate it only when the size changes. Create the texture with `COPY_DST` and `RENDER_ATTACHMENT` usage, and pass the texture size as `size`.
- **MANDATORY**: Sync the geometry of the HTML element with the rendered content. In 2D, `drawElementImage` does it automatically. In WebGL and WebGPU, call `canvas.updateElementGeometry(element, { canvasTransform })`.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `ResizeObserver` to observe the screen size and update the canvas size to match device pixels.
- **DO NOT** embed cross-origin content in a canvas, as it is not supported.
- **DO NOT** initialize `ResizeObserver` within the `onpaint` event handler, as it may lead to memory leaks.

## Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("canvas-html") }}

The HTML-in-Canvas API is not currently supported in all modern browsers, thus a fallback strategy is typically required. However, given the improved performance benefits of this API, HTML-in-Canvas should be used if the browser supports it.

For the use case where HTML content needs to be exported from a canvas, use libraries like `html2canvas`, `dom-to-image`, or `snapdom`. 

To capture HTML interactions frame by frame, for example, for streaming, capture DOM mutations using libraries like `rrweb`. 

Alternatively, implement a warning that HTML media export is not supported in the browser because it doesn't support HTML-in-Canvas.
