# Theming browser-generated UI

Most browser-generated UI can be customized to some extent using CSS.
Even if it requires modern features, it degrades gracefully in older browsers, and thus often does not require a polyfill or fallback.

Before re-creating browser UI (form controls, scrollbars, selections, error messages, etc), first verify that:
1. the browser UI cannot be customized enough for your needs, even with modern CSS,
2. the desired customization is sufficiently critical to justify the tradeoffs of re-creating built-in UI — most notably losing accessible semantics, keyboard handling, IME, and AT integration that the native UI provides for free.

Example customizations that are possible:
- Use `::selection` to customize highlighted text colors.
- **DON'T** apply `user-select: none` to content text — breaks copy-paste, translation tools, and AT "read from here" gestures. Limit it to chrome (drag handles, toolbars, redundant button labels).
- Use `accent-color` to apply the page's accent color to any browser-generated UI.
- Use `color-scheme` to have browser UI adapt to light/dark mode.
- Use `scrollbar-color` to customize scrollbar colors — keep the thumb visibly distinct from the track (contrast ≥3:1)
- **DON'T** use the `scrollbar-width` with any value other than `auto`, unless another accessible option is provided to scroll content. Although `scrollbar-width: thin` does provide a thumb, the target size of the thumb will be too small for some users to operate.
- Use `:user-invalid` / `:user-valid` for validity styling, **not** `:invalid` / `:valid` — they only match after the user has interacted with the field, avoiding the hostile default of flagging required-empty fields as errors on page load. Exclude range sliders when targeting `input` broadly (e.g., `input:not(input[type="range"]):user-valid`) so adjusting a slider does not apply field validity borders or backgrounds to it.
- Buttons and text fields (including `<textarea>`) can generally be styled as normal elements.
- Use `font-size` to scale and other textual properties to control typography
- Use text color contrast between the foreground and background colors of at least 4.5:1 for regular size text or at least `3:1` for large-scale text (18 point or 14 point bold font size).
- Use a contrast between adjacent colors of at least `3:1` for non-text content.

### Styling textual fields (`<input>` & `<textarea>`)

For most styling purposes (e.g. colors, borders, backgrounds, typography, etc) treat these elements as normal text containers.

- Use `:placeholder-shown` and `::placeholder` to style input placeholders.
- Use `field-sizing: content` to make text fields size to content.
- For `<textarea>` elements, use `resize: vertical` to disable horizontal resizing.
- Do not use `resize: none` on `<textarea>` elements to disable all resizing.

### Multiple choice controls (select, radios, checkboxes)

- To select one among many options presented in a dropdown: Use a `<select>` + `appearance: base-select` + `::picker(select)`. For more info see {{ GUIDE_REF("branded-select-styling") }}
- Selecting one or more among multiple options laid out inline in the page: Use a `<input type=checkbox>` or `<input type=radio>` inside a `<label>` for each option. Style via `label:has(:checked)`.
- Style checkboxes, radios and switches via `appearance: none` + generated content (`::before`/`::after`) or background images to draw the checked state.
<!-- Customizable select listbox version currently buggy + this has much better browser support -->

### Non-textual `<input>`s (buttons, sliders, file inputs etc.)

- File inputs: Use `::file-selector-button` to style the button.
- Do not use `<input>` with a `type` of `button`, `submit` or `reset`. Use `<button>` instead and style it as a regular element.
- Sliders: Use `appearance: none` + thumb pseudo-elements (`::-webkit-slider-thumb`, `::-moz-range-thumb`, etc) and track pseudo-elements (`::-webkit-slider-runnable-track`, `::-moz-range-track`, etc) for more granular control.
