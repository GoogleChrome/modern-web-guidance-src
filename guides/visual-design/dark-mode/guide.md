# Dark mode

The `color-scheme` property indicates which color schemes (such as light or dark) your page supports. This informs the browser that it can automatically theme native UI elements—like scrollbars, form controls, and the default canvas background—to match your site's design and help minimize white flashes during initial loading.

## Implementation

### 1. Declare supported schemes in HTML

MANDATORY: To help prevent a "flash of un-themed content" (FOUC), place a `<meta>` tag in your `<head>` to ensure the browser knows which themes you support before it even starts rendering. While this `<meta>` tag helps to avoid FOUC by setting the initial canvas color early, it may not completely eliminate flashes in all browsers or loading conditions.

```html
<!-- MANDATORY: Declare support for both light and dark themes -->
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
```

### 2. Apply page-wide color scheme to CSS :root or html

MANDATORY: Apply the `color-scheme` property to the `html` element or the `:root` pseudo-class. Browsers specifically look to the root element to determine the theme for the entire viewport—including the root scrollbars and the initial "canvas" background. If applied only to the `body`, these global UI surfaces may remain in light mode because the `body` does not control the window's rendering context.

```css
/* MANDATORY: Apply color-scheme to :root or html for viewport-wide theming */
:root {
  /* MANDATORY: Automatically adapt native UI to user system preferences */
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
```

### 3. Define light and dark color tokens

You can use the `light-dark()` function to define color tokens that automatically adapt to different `color-scheme` values.

It is recommended that you also keep the raw color values in separate custom properties, which makes it easier to combine them in different ways (and makes fallback behavior easier, if needed).

For more control over the colors of built-in UI such as `accent-color` or `scrollbar-color`, authors **can optionally** add their own dynamic colors with use of custom properties and/or the `light-dark()` function. This function automatically picks the correct color based on the computed `color-scheme` of the element and eliminates the need for redundant media queries, but is not required for a basic implementation.

```css
:root {
  --color-brand-light: oklch(45% 0.23 270);
  --color-brand-dark: oklch(85% 0.15 210);
  --color-brand-text-light: white;
  --color-brand-text-dark: oklch(40% 0.23 270);

  --color-brand: light-dark(var(--color-brand-light), var(--color-brand-dark));
  --color-brand-text: light-dark(var(--color-brand-text-light), var(--color-brand-text-dark));

  /* MANDATORY: Automatically adapt native UI to user system preferences */
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

button.primary {
  /* These automatically adapt to color scheme */
  background-color: var(--color-brand);
  color: var(--color-brand-text);
}
```

OPTIONAL: A number of system colors are available, which also automatically adapt to the used color scheme (and other color modes, e.g. forced colors), such as `canvas`, `canvastext`, `accentcolor` (check support) , `buttonborder` etc. These are typically too limited to be useful, beyond very specific cases where you need to exactly match certain default browser UI or as fallbacks/defaults.

#### OPTIONAL: Tailor color pairs to context

Even when overriding the system default, it can be useful to use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to define **different** color pairs that take into account the colors of the browser and OS chrome around the page (or of the surrounding page, when the page is used as an iframe).

For example, use a slightly dimmer light theme when the system setting is `dark`, or a more contrasting dark theme when the system setting is `light`, so the page is not visually overpowered by the surrounding UI.


## Fine-grained browser UI customization

Setting `color-scheme` already adapts browser UI to the used color scheme, but this will use OS defaults and/or system colors that may not perfectly align with the website design.
Modern browsers expose several fine-grained customization hooks for these.
Do not reimplement native controls simply to customize their appearance without exhausting the customization hooks modern browsers provide.

### Setting the accent color

Some browser UI (e.g. checked checkboxes or sliders) uses an accent color.
This resolves to the OS setting by default, but you can use the `accent-color` property to set it to a color that better aligns with the page, such as the page's brand color.

```css
html {
  accent-color: light-dark(var(--color-accent-light), var(--color-accent-dark));
}
```

### Scrollbar colors

You can use `scrollbar-color` together with `light-dark()` to set custom scrollbar colors that adapt to the color scheme used.

```css
:root {
  --color-scrollbar-track: light-dark(#eee, #222);
  --color-scrollbar-thumb: light-dark(#999, #666);
  scrollbar-color: var(--color-scrollbar-thumb) var(--color-scrollbar-track);
}
```

### Further customization

Most browser UI exposes pseudo-elements to fully customize its appearance, such as:
- `::placeholder`
- `::spelling-error`
- `::grammar-error`
- `::selection`
- `::search-text`
- `::target-text`
- `::file-selector-button`

You can use `light-dark()` colors on any of these to apply colors that adapt to the used color scheme.

## JS-based theme detection

Most color scheme branching should be done in CSS, which automatically adapts to changes.

Any JS reading `matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches` MUST also handle its `change` event as the system preference can change at any time.

## OPTIONAL: Implementing a color-scheme toggle

If you want to allow users to manually override their system default for this site, you can implement a dark mode toggle.
See {{ GUIDE_REF("dark-mode-toggle") }} for best practices around implementing this.

## OPTIONAL: Component-specific overrides

You can override the global theme for specific elements by setting `color-scheme` on them.
