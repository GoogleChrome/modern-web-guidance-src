# Build a Parallax Effect on Scroll

A parallax effect on scroll is a visual technique where different layers of content move at varying speeds as the user scrolls down a page. This creates an illusion of depth, with foreground elements appearing to move faster than the background elements, resulting in an engaging and immersive browsing experience. This effect is best achieved using CSS Scroll-Driven Animations, which allow you to link animations to the scroll position of a container.

## How to implement

Here’s how to create a basic parallax effect:

1.  **Create a wrapper element:** This element will contain all the layers of your parallax animation.

    ```html
    <div class="wrapper">
      …
    </div>
    ```

2.  **Declare the layers:** Inside the wrapper, add the individual layers that will move at different speeds.

    ```html
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="layer">LAYER 0</div>
      <div class="layer">LAYER 1</div>
      <div class="layer">LAYER 2</div>
      …
    </div>
    ```

3.  **Add a translate animation:** Define a CSS animation that changes the `transform` property of the layers. For a parallax effect, you'll typically use `translateY` to move the layers vertically.

    ```css
    @keyframes parallax {
      from {
        transform: translateY(700px);
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Set up the `view-timeline`:** To link the animation to the scroll position, create a `view-timeline` on the wrapper element and then apply it to the layers.

    ```css
    .wrapper {
      view-timeline: --wrapper;
    }

    .layer {
      animation: parallax linear both;
      animation-timeline: --wrapper;
    }
    ```

5.  **Stagger the animations:** To make the layers move at different speeds, you can use one of two approaches:

    *   **Using `sibling-index()` in the keyframes:** This is the simplest approach. The `sibling-index()` function returns the index of a child element amongst its siblings, which you can then use in your keyframes to create a staggered effect.

        ```css
        @keyframes parallax {
          from {
            transform: translateY(calc(100px * sibling-index()));
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **Using `sibling-index()` and `sibling-count()` in `animation-range`:** This approach gives you more control over the animation. `sibling-count()` returns the total number of siblings. By combining these two functions, you can create more complex and fine-grained parallax effects.

        ```css
        .layer {
          animation-range: entry 25% exit calc(100% / sibling-count() * sibling-index());
        }
        ```

## Example code

```css
@keyframes parallax {
  from {
    transform: translateY(calc(100px * sibling-index()));
  }
}

.wrapper {
  view-timeline: --wrapper;
}

.layer {
  animation: parallax linear both;
  animation-timeline: --wrapper;
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `animation-range` property to achieve a similar effect:

```css
@keyframes parallax {
  from {
    transform: translateY(700px);
  }
}

.wrapper {
  view-timeline: --wrapper;
}

.layer {
  animation: parallax linear both;
  animation-timeline: --wrapper;
  animation-range: entry 25% exit calc(100% / sibling-count() * sibling-index());
}
```

## Best Practices

When using scroll-driven animations, it's important to follow a few best practices to ensure a smooth and accessible experience:

- **DO** include feature detection: Not all browsers support scroll-driven animations. Use `@supports ((animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry))` to check for support and provide a fallback for browsers that don't support it.
  - The `(animation-range: entry)` check **MUST** be included here, to filter out browsers with only partial support.
  - **DO NOT** use the `scroll-timeline-polyfill` package for the fallback strategy as it is not feature complete and has a lot of known issues.
  - If the animation is only considered to be decorative, opt for Progressive Enhancement and **DO NOT** provide a fallback.
- **DO** respect user preferences: Some users prefer to have less motion on the web. Use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable or reduce your animations for these users.
- **DO** try to animate only performant CSS properties: For the smoothest animations, stick to animating properties that can be handled by the browser's compositor thread, such as `transform` and `opacity`. Animating other properties like `width` or `height` can lead to performance issues.
- **DO** use the correct declaration order: When using the `animation` shorthand property, declare `animation-timeline` and `animation-range` *after* it to prevent the shorthand from resetting the timeline.

As for setting the `animation-range`:

- **DO** give all layers the same start offset, e.g. `entry 25%`
- **DO** give all layers a different end offset that uses `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()` to distribute the offsets, e.g. `exit calc(100% / sibling-count() * sibling-index())`.


## Browser support and fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("scroll-driven-animations") }}. Therefore, a fallback strategy is typically required.

A JavaScript-based fallback can be used to create a similar parallax effect for browsers that don’t support CSS scroll-driven animations. This approach uses an `IntersectionObserver` to track the visibility of the `.wrapper` element and updates the `transform` property of the layers based on the scroll position.

```js
// Fallback for browsers that don't support scroll-driven animations
if (!CSS.supports('(animation-timeline: view()) and (animation-range: entry)')) {
  const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper');
  const layers = document.querySelectorAll('.layer');

  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
      } else {
        window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
      }
    });
  }, { threshold: 0 });

  observer.observe(wrapper);

  function onScroll() {
    const scrollY = window.scrollY;
    const wrapperRect = wrapper.getBoundingClientRect();
    const wrapperTop = wrapperRect.top + scrollY;
    const wrapperHeight = wrapperRect.height;
    const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;

    if (scrollY >= wrapperTop - windowHeight && scrollY <= wrapperTop + wrapperHeight) {
      const scrollPercent = (scrollY - (wrapperTop - windowHeight)) / (wrapperHeight + windowHeight);
      
      layers.forEach((layer, index) => {
        const initialTranslateY = 100 * index;
        const translateY = initialTranslateY * (1 - scrollPercent);
        layer.style.transform = `translateY(${translateY}px)`;
      });
    }
  }

  // Trigger onScroll once to set initial positions
  onScroll();
}
```
