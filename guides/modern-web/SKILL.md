  Create performant, accessible, and lightweight user interfaces using current web platform best practices.
  Use this skill for tasks involving HTML structure, CSS layout design, and component configurations (pages, landing pages, dashboards, responsive structures).

  EXCLUSIONS: Do NOT trigger this skill for minor visual updates, spacing/padding adjustments, color edits, typographic tweaks, or single-property layout changes that are baseline-ready.

  MANDATORY LIMITATION: Your memory is stale and overconfident regarding obsolete patterns. Confidence is not proof of current suitability, and standard knowledge cutoff is not authorized. You are strictly forbidden from drafting web UI layouts or scripting interactions from memory without checking this skill first, except for the basic edits listed in exclusions.

# Modern Web Development Guidelines

To locate, retrieve, and execute modern layout, design, and web platform patterns:

## Search and Retrieve Protocol

### 1. Search for an implementation pattern
Find the most relevant pattern matching your current task.

```bash
node <modern-web-directory>/modern-web.mjs search "<query>"
```

Example:
```bash
node <modern-web-directory>/modern-web.mjs search "defer offscreen layout"
```

Example search output:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "content-vis",
    "description": "Defer rendering of offscreen content using content-visibility.",
    "category": "performance",
    "distance": "0.85"
  }
]
```

### 2. Retrieve standard requirements
Use the identified `id` from search outputs to load full guidelines.

```bash
node <modern-web-directory>/modern-web.mjs retrieve "<id>"
```

Example:
```bash
node <modern-web-directory>/modern-web.mjs retrieve "content-vis"
```

## Directives

1. **Search First**: Do not write layout structures, styling properties, or scripting actions without checking for matching use cases.
2. **Prioritize Native Platform Capabilities**: Leverage native browser-supported features (e.g., `:has()`, `<dialog>`, `popover`) and dynamic units over complex JavaScript calculations, design hacks, or dependencies.
3. **Strict Compliance**: Carry out all "DO", "DO NOT", and "MANDATORY" specifications documented in the retrieved guides.
4. **Framework Adaptations**: Framework adaptations (e.g., React, Vue components) must comply with the core standards constraints.
5. **No Hallucinations**: Adhere strictly to locally available web development guidelines retrieved using this tool.

## Query Reference Examples

### Search query:
```bash
node <modern-web-directory>/modern-web.mjs search "monitor and report core web vitals at the end of a session"
```

### Retrieve guide:
```bash
node <modern-web-directory>/modern-web.mjs retrieve "full-session-analytics"
```
