# Carousel Snap Highlights

Scroll-state container queries allow you to style elements based on their current scroll state, such as whether an element is "stuck" (via sticky positioning) or "snapped" (via scroll snapping). This enables carousel or gallery experiences where the active item can be visually distinguished without relying on JavaScript intersection observers or scroll event listeners.

### Core implementation

To highlight snapped items, you must establish a scroll-snap container, define the snap targets as scroll-state containers, and then query that state to style descendants.

#### 1. Establish the scroll snap container
The parent container must have `scroll-snap-type` enabled.

```html
<div class="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-item">
    <div class="card">Product 1 content</div>
  </div>
  <div class="carousel-item">
    <div class="card">Product 2 content</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.carousel {
  display: flex;
  overflow-x: auto;
  /* MANDATORY: Enable scroll snapping on the container */
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}
```

#### 2. Define snap targets as scroll-state containers
Each item in the carousel that should be tracked for snapping must be declared as a `scroll-state` container.

```css
.carousel-item {
  /* Define where the item snaps within the container */
  scroll-snap-align: center;
  
  /* MANDATORY: Establish this element as a scroll-state query container */
  container-type: scroll-state;
}
```

#### 3. Query the `snapped` state

Because container queries style **descendants**, you must apply the highlight styles to an element *inside* the snap target.  Because the scroll container is set to overflow on the x axis, use the `scroll-state(snapped: x)` query.

**MANDATORY**: Wrap the styles in ` @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` to only show the effect to users who have not requested reduced motion. Depending on your use case, you may retain portions of the effect, but in this case, the cards flash from white to blue in a way that may cause problems for some users, so we disable it completely.

```css
/* Specify transition outside of queries so that it is applied regardless of state.  */
.card {
  transition:
    scale 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1),
    background-color 0.4s,
    color 0.4s,
    box-shadow 0.4s;
}
/* 
Only show the effect for users not requesting reduced motion. Disable completely, including the color change, as it causes a flash that may be problematic.
*/
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  /* Style the content when its parent .carousel-item is snapped on the x axis */
  @container scroll-state(snapped: x) {
    .card {
      background: #007bff;
      color: white;
      scale: 1.15;
      box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.3);
    }
  }
}

/* MANDATORY Copy-Paste Safety: Disable highlight scaling/flashing for motion sensitive users */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card {
    transition: none !important;
    scale: 1 !important;
  }
}
```

The `snapped` descriptor can query specific axes: `x`, `y`, `inline`, `block`, or `both`.

### Accessibility

* **DON'T** use `scroll-state` as a way to have people select an option.
* **AVOID**: using `scroll-state` with interactive elements.

Visual highlights for snapped items can improve the UX, but the snapped item is not exposed to the accessibility tree. Therefore, snapping an item must not be used as a way of selecting content, and as a result, the visual theme applied to a snapped item must not convey that the element is active or focused. A sufficiently contrasting keyboard focus ring (with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors) should be distinct from the `snapped` highlight. If the snapped item is interactive, you must use other standard accessibility practices to make it accessible.  

Snapping occurs due to scrolling, which does not move keyboard focus. However, if focus moves to an element inside the scroll container, this may cause the scroll container to move, causing a change in the snapped item, which may or may not be the focused item. This will likely be a source of confusion for users and is why including interactive elements in the container is discouraged.

> [!NOTE]
> This pattern does not represent a traditional carousel component in which slides typically automatically change, in a way that doesn't allow people to pause or stop the transition, or accurately communicate the visible information to people using screen readers. If the intended use case is a carousel that only presents a single slide at any time, then do not use this technique, as it lacks the accessibility information required for such a component. Instead, opt for a tab-like implementation, ensuring that the carousel can be operated using a keyboard alone, that the carousel can be paused or stopped, and that the semantic information including the name, role, and state, is accurately conveyed to people using screen readers. Making carousel components accessible to everyone is highly nuanced and context-dependent; be sure to refer to established accessibility standards and perform thorough user testing for production environments.

For content in the container that is not currently highlighted, ensure that this content is not inadvertently made difficult to perceive. For example, don't make the non-highlighted items in a gallery greyscale with a low opacity, only receiving adequate contrast once scroll snapped and highlighted. The content must always have sufficient contrast, in order for it to be perceivable, and to allow people to understand that there is more content that they can navigate to.

Finally, to ensure consistent operability across different browsers and assistive technology combinations, ensure that the scrollable container can receive focus (by applying `tabindex="0"`), and has an accessible name that describes the content, along with an appropriate role (such as `role="region"`).

```html
<div class="carousel-snap" role="region" aria-label="Highlights" tabindex="0">
  …
</div>
```

## Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("container-scroll-state-queries") }}

For browsers that do not support scroll-state queries, you should provide a functional base experience where all items are legible, even without the "active" highlight.

#### Feature detection
You can use `@supports` to provide enhancements only to supported browsers:

```css
@supports (container-type: scroll-state) {
  /* Enhancement styles here */
}
```

#### JavaScript fallback

If the highlight is critical for the user experience, use `IntersectionObserver` to determine the snapped item. Adjust the observed area to a thin slice in the center of the carousel by providing a `rootMargin` with a negative inline value. For example, to consider an element to be intersecting if it is in the center 2% of the carousel, set the `rootMargin` to `"0px -49%"`.  

```javascript
// Optional: detect support and apply a JS-based fallback
if (!CSS.supports('container-type', 'scroll-state')) {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      // Toggle a class based on intersection
      entry.target.classList.toggle('is-snapped', entry.isIntersecting);
    });
  }, {
    root: document.querySelector(".carousel"),
    // Carousel item intersects if any part of the carousel item is in the middle 2% of the carousel.
    rootMargin: "0px -49%"
  });

  document.querySelectorAll('.carousel-item').forEach(item => {
    observer.observe(item);
  });
}
```
