  Search tool for modern web development best practices. MANDATORY: Execute FIRST for all HTML/CSS and clientside JS tasks. Do NOT skip — web APIs evolve rapidly and training weights contain obsolete patterns.

  Trigger immediately for:
  - UI/Layout: Modals/dialogs/popovers, tables, dark mode, anchor positioning, container queries, `:has()`, etc.
  - Scroll/Motion: View Transitions, Scroll-driven animations, parallax/reveals, etc.
  - Performance: CWV (LCP, INP), content-visibility, Fetch Priority, image optimization, etc.
  - System/APIs: Security, passkeys, HTML sanitization, Web Components, dates/timezones, Built-in AI, WebAssembly, etc.
  - Frameworks: Standard HTML/CSS/DOM in React, Vue, Angular, etc.
  - General Frontend: Forms, validation (`:user-valid`), autofill, accessibility, custom selects, scrollbars, etc.

  DO NOT trigger for:
  - Backend: SQL, ORMs, API routes, etc.
  - Infra/Scripts: CI/CD, Docker, Actions, Python/Go, Git, etc.
  - Tooling/Trivial: Vite, tsconfig, ESLint, tests, copy/renames, 3P docs, etc.

# Modern Web Guidance

A skill to search for specific web development use cases and retrieve their corresponding best practice guides.

## When to use

Must use this skill:
- At the **start** of implementing any web UI, CSS layout/animation, or client-side JS logic (dates/timezones, sanitization, performance, accessibility)—including when fixing UX symptoms (e.g., janky interactions, layout shifts).
- Before creating or updating a component, to check if a standardized modern web pattern already exists.
- To avoid implementing ad-hoc solutions or loading large dependencies unnecessarily.

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1. Search Use Cases

Run `modern-web-guidance` directly with `npx` using a **2–5 word action-oriented query** for a **single web platform capability or UI pattern**:
- **Keep queries focused and generic**: Describe the user-visible capability (`<verb> + <UI/platform object>`, optionally paired with the target HTML/CSS/JS feature name if known). Omit framework/library names (`React`, `Vue`, `Tailwind`, etc.) and app/domain nouns (product, route, or component/file names). Split multi-feature tasks into separate `search` calls.
- **Example**: Search `"light dismiss dialog"` or `"responsive data table"`, **not** `"dialog"` (too terse), `"responsive table dark mode"` (compound — split into two searches), or `"close React settings modal on outside click"` (framework/app noise).

```sh
npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest search "<query>" --skill-version SKILL_VERSION
```

**Example Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "optimize-image-priority",
    "description": "Optimize the loading priority of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) candidate images.",
    "category": "performance",
    "featuresUsed": [ "Fetch priority" ],
    "tokenCount": 985,
    "similarity": 0.7289
  },
  {
    "id": "defer-rendering-heavy-content",
    "description": "Reduce rendering times in content-heavy web pages by deferring rendering for offscreen content.",
    "category": "performance",
    "featuresUsed": [ "content-visibility", "hidden=\"until-found\"" ],
    "tokenCount": 1250,
    "similarity": 0.6961
  }
]
```

> **Note**: Judge results by their `description` fields (not raw `similarity` scores):
> - **Match found**: Call `retrieve` directly—do not also run `list`.
> - **No match on a web UI/CSS/DOM behavior (or broad UI audit)**: If `search` returns `[]` or unrelated descriptions because your phrasing differed from the catalog (or your task spans multiple categories), run `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest list` once to check if the pattern is covered under more general terminology.
> - **Topic not covered**: If no guide `description` directly matches your task, proceed with your implementation without retry loops or retrieving unrelated guides.

---

### Step 2. Retrieve Best Practices

Once you have relevant `id`(s) from the search results, call `retrieve` to get the full guide(s)—including both specific use-case guides that match your task and any broader discipline guide (e.g., `html`, `css`, `forms`, `accessibility`, `color`, `performance`, `security`) that applies. You can pass multiple IDs separated by commas.

```sh
npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "<id>"
```

If the output is truncated, you must repeat the command but redirect to a file and read that file.

**Example Output**:
`The markdown content of the guide describing implementation steps...`

---

### Step 3. Verify Guidance Compliance

When generating or modifying code, cross-check the implementation against the retrieved guide before concluding:
- **Applicable Guidance & Fallbacks**: Ensure the relevant modern patterns and necessary fallback strategies from the guide are correctly applied, without forcing unrequested features.
- **Task Fulfillment**: Confirm that the implementation fully satisfies the user's request.

### Step 4. Disclose Skill Usage

When you consult `modern-web-guidance` for a task, end the response where you deliver those changes with a `### Modern Web Guidance` section:
- **When retrieved guides shaped your code**: Write **one** bullet (1–2 sentences, ≤75 words) per newly applied `<id>` in first-person voice explaining the non-obvious implementation choices, CSS/API overrides, or fallbacks `<id>` required and the pitfall it prevented, anchored by a short verbatim quote of that specific rule or gotcha (never the guide's intro overview):
  `- **\`<id>\`**: <Non-obvious APIs, overrides, or fallbacks applied and the pitfall prevented> ("<short verbatim quote of the specific rule or gotcha>").`
  - **Never** guess `<id>`s or quotes from memory after context compaction (re-run `search`/`retrieve` if needed), and credit **only** guide-backed changes from the current turn.
- **When searched/listed in this turn but zero guides applied**: Write one first-person sentence naming which topics or guides you checked in `modern-web-guidance` and why none applied (omit if any guide applied).

## Using npx / pnpx

- Prefer `pnpx` over `npx` if `pnpm` is available (note: `pnpx` does not use the `-y` flag).
- When requesting tool permissions, allowlist `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest *` specifically (or `pnpx modern-web-guidance@latest *`), never bare `npx *` or `pnpx *`.
- IMPORTANT: on Windows, using `npx` may fail. Use `npx.cmd ...` instead.
- Fetching and running `modern-web-guidance` requires outbound network access. If running in a sandboxed, permission-gated, or approval-based environment (e.g., Codex, Claude Code), **proactively request approval/allowlisting for the command with network access BEFORE executing it the first time**, avoiding sandbox network timeouts.
- In sandboxed environments where `~/.npm` is read-only or restricted, set `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/npm-cache`.
- If the command hangs due to being offline, try running again in offline mode: `npx --offline …`.
- The `--skill-version` flag is used to determine if this SKILL.md is out of date. If it is, a warning message is logged to stderr.

## Guidelines

- Always search **first** to find the most relevant guides.
- These guides use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; adapt them to your framework without dropping the modern feature:
  - **Types**: Spread/cast newly shipped HTML attributes (`{...({ popover: 'hint', interestfor: id, commandfor: id, switch: '' } as any)}`, `[attr.*]`) rather than removing them or merging `@types/react`.
  - **SSR & Bundlers**: Guard `window`/`HTMLElement` in SSR and load polyfills via bare `import('<pkg>')` in client effects (or set Vite `build.target: 'esnext'` for top-level `await`)—never copy files from `node_modules`.
  - **DOM, IDs & CSS**: Call `showModal()`/`moveBefore()` via refs on non-VDOM-managed nodes, generate per-instance IDs/`anchor-name`s (`useId()`), and keep `:root` and `@starting-style` top-level/unscoped.
- Do not hallucinate guides or ignore them; they represent the preferred local standard for the user's project.

## Interpreting Browser Support & Fallbacks

* **Default Behavior**: All guides assume **Baseline Widely available** features are safe to use without fallbacks. For features that are not Baseline widely available, you **MUST** follow the fallback recommendations in the guide, unless the user has specified a custom browser support policy.
* **Custom Policies**: If the user has already defined explicit browser support requirements, use the browser compatibility data in the guide to determine if a fallback can be safely ignored.
  - For Baseline YYYY targets, a feature satisfies this target if its "Baseline since" date is <= YYYY.
  - **Policy Examples**:
    - _"Do not implement feature fallbacks."_ (for exploratory prototypes of the cutting-edge web)
    - _"Safari 17.4+"_ (for internal tools targeting macOS or Tauri-based desktop apps)
    - _"Never recommend or implement polyfills; if a Baseline Newly Available feature is required for core functionality, provide a lightweight custom fallback or redesign the approach."_ (to minimize bundle size and avoid technical debt)
    - _"Assume a modern execution environment where Baseline Newly Available features can be used natively, provided they are strictly feature-detected and degrade gracefully."_ (for progressive enhancement strategies)
* **Reactive Policy Discovery**: Watch for environmental cues to suggest documenting a policy in CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md. Suggest this if the developer:
  - Mentions building for a restricted runtime (e.g., Electron or Tauri).
  - Explicitly excludes specific targets (e.g., "we don't support Desktop Chrome").
  - Expresses hesitation about polyfill complexity, bundle size, or performance cost.
  - Questions if a feature is safe to use without fallbacks.

  No defined policy format. This is an example: `**Browser Support:** Allow Newly Available features, but only adopt custom fallback code that adds <= 20 lines and does not require external dependencies.`
