A dark mode toggle lets users override the system color scheme for one site.
The override is applied by updating `<meta name="color-scheme">`: `light dark` means "follow the system preference", `light` or `dark` pin an explicit scheme.
Colors (`light-dark()`), system colors, and native UI all key off the CSS `color-scheme` property, so the toggle works by keeping that property in sync with the `<meta>` (see [Reflect the override in CSS](#reflect-the-override-in-css)).

## Persistent toggle, settings control, or no toggle at all?

Most sites do not need a persistent color scheme toggle in the site UI (header, nav, footer, etc.).
Follow the system preference by default and, if a manual override is needed at all, put the control in a separate settings surface: a settings page, panel, or overlay.

Pinning a scheme against the OS is a legitimate but rare intent, and rare intents belong behind progressive disclosure, not in a control that is visible at all times.

{# Should we recommend some kind of toggle for websites that intentionally _don't_ default to the system color scheme? #}

Persistent toggles are mostly found on developer-facing or developer-adjacent (e.g. for designers) sites, where switching schemes is a far more frequent task than it is for the average web user.
Do NOT add one just because it is a common pattern on developer sites: the developer's interest in this control is not representative of typical users.

## Implementation

First, follow all steps in {{ GUIDE_REF("dark-mode") }} to support both schemes, defaulting to the system preference.

### Data model

The data model for the dark mode toggle typically includes three states:
1. System (no stored value): The UI follows the system color scheme. Ideally this should be the default.
2. Light (stored as `"light"`): The UI uses the light theme regardless of the system color scheme.
3. Dark (stored as `"dark"`): The UI uses the dark theme regardless of the system color scheme.

This state is usually stored in `localStorage` and reflected in a `<meta name="color-scheme">` element in the document head.

{# TODO how to handle sites that are dark by default? We need to cover that to be realistic… #}

### Reflect the override in CSS

The `<meta>` is only a *presentational hint*: any `color-scheme` declaration in author CSS overrides it.
Since {{ GUIDE_REF("dark-mode") }} sets `color-scheme: light dark` on `:root`, updating the `<meta>` alone is a **no-op** — CSS wins.
Map the `<meta>` back to the property so the cascade follows it:

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;

  &:has(> head > meta[name="color-scheme"][content="dark"]) {
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
  &:has(> head > meta[name="color-scheme"][content="light"]) {
    color-scheme: light;
  }
}
```

**DO NOT** hardcode `color-scheme: light` or `color-scheme: dark` as the root default; the base declaration MUST stay `light dark`.
CSS MUST NOT depend on JS: if JS never runs, the `<meta>` stays `light dark` and the site follows the system preference — nothing breaks.

### Persistence and FOUC prevention

Persist the override in `localStorage`; remove the entry when returning to the system default.

To avoid a flash of the wrong scheme, apply the stored value in an inline script (NOT `type=module`, NOT `defer`) placed immediately after the `<meta>` element:

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
<script>
document.querySelector('meta[name="color-scheme"]').content = localStorage.getItem("color-scheme") ?? "light dark";
</script>
```

- This inline script exists **only** for FOUC prevention. Keep it as small as possible; the rest of the component's JS can load later.
- In rare cases `localStorage` access can throw (e.g. site data blocked), but since this script does nothing else, the only side effect would be a console error. Wrap in `try .. catch` if this matters. Ensure the theme is still applied to the page, even if it cannot be persisted.
- The override can change from another tab: handle `window`'s `storage` event to stay in sync.
- **DO NOT** use `matchMedia()` to remove the stored value when the system preference changes to match it.
Many users' OS switches schemes automatically based on time of day; removing the stored value whenever the two happen to coincide would make it impossible to pin a scheme at all.

### Branching for HTML and non-color values

Colors need no extra work: once the `<meta>` is mapped to `color-scheme` (above), `light-dark()` follows the override.
This section is about adapting other values (e.g. `font-weight`, media sources, etc.).

When the page simply follows the system preference, `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` can be used for branching, including in `<picture>` or `<video>` sources.
Overriding the color scheme adds an additional complication: the system preference is no longer the source of truth, and for APIs that only accept media queries there is no direct alternative.

Do NOT rely exclusively on JS-applied classes like `.dark` for branching, as they will be incorrect if JS doesn't load and the OS default is dark.

You can combine the media query with a `:root:has(> head > meta[name="color-scheme"][content="dark"])` (or `light`) selector to branch.
See {{ GUIDE_REF("selector-atrule-combinations") }} for details on how to implement this elegantly.

The control's own options are non-color branches too: include both states in the markup (icon plus visually hidden action text, e.g. "Switch to dark theme") and hide the inactive one via these selectors.
`display: none` also removes the redundant option from the AT so the control needs no JS to stay current when the system preference changes.

For in-HTML media, the only way right now is to include both versions as separate elements and toggle visibility appropriately.
Hiding `<source>` elements with `display: none` does not work.

## User Interface

### Two or three states?

In all cases, the UI MUST support reverting or setting the color scheme to system.

Prefer displaying two states in space-constrained toggles, such as persistent toggles in the site chrome (header, nav, footer, etc.) where space is limited and tweaking settings is usually orthogonal to the user goal.

A color scheme control in a separate settings surface (page, panel, or overlay) is a different scenario and MAY expose all three states explicitly ("Light", "Dark", "System"): there, the user is already making deliberate decisions about future behavior, and there is room to explain the options.

Three explicit states are also warranted if the site implements context-aware schemes (e.g. a dimmer light mode when the OS is dark), since "Light" and "System (currently light)" then genuinely differ.

### Two-state toggles

When such a control is used, it tends to be a temporary comfort adjustment ("it's too bright right now"), rather than ensuring the current state is preserved long-term.
Therefore, for two-state toggles, it is sufficient to display two out of three settings: system (so that the setting can be reverted) and the current opposite of system, stored as its current literal value.

The only two states should be:

1. **System default** — no stored value, `<meta>` content `light dark`. Displayed as its current resolved value (e.g. a sun icon when light).
2. **Override** — stored literally as `light` or `dark`.

Essentially, it is a tri-state control (`light dark`, `light`, `dark`) where the explicit state matching the current system preference is unreachable.

On each toggle:

1. Target scheme = the opposite of the currently *rendered* scheme (stored value if any, else system preference). The user intent is "select the opposite of what I see right now", NOT "select the inverse of the system default".
2. If the target differs from the current system preference, store it literally.
3. If the target matches the current system preference, the user is undoing their adjustment: remove the stored value. DO NOT store it — that would invisibly pin the scheme against future system changes.
4. Set the `<meta>` content to the stored value, or `light dark` if none.

IMPORTANT: Divergence must be checked only at storage time, never retroactively: a stored value that the system preference later changes to match MUST be kept.
Many users' OS switches schemes automatically based on time of day; removing the stored value whenever the two happen to coincide would make it impossible to pin a scheme at all.

Example scenario, starting with the OS set to light:

1. The user toggles. Dark differs from the system preference, so `dark` is stored; the site turns dark.
2. The OS setting changes to dark. The site stays dark (the stored value now matches the system preference, but is kept).
3. The OS setting changes back to light. The site stays dark.
4. The user toggles. The target (light) matches the system preference, so the stored value is removed and the site follows the system again.

### Three-state toggles

When there is more space and users are already in the mindset of setting long-term preferences, a tri-state control can provide more clarity.
In this case, the data model cleanly maps to the three UI options: system, light, and dark.

To reduce cognitive load, the "system" option should also display what the current system setting is, for example via:
- Icon, e.g. a sun icon at the bottom right of the system icon
- Text, e.g. "System (Currently light)"
