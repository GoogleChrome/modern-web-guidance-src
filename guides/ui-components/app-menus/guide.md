# Build an application menu bar

An application menu bar (File, Edit, View, Help) is a row of menus that behaves as one widget: one `Tab` stop, `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` move between menus, focusing a menu title shows its menu, and once one menu is open, pointing at another title switches to it. Use it for an application command bar.

Do not use it for site navigation (a short list of links users `Tab` through) or for a few unrelated menu buttons in a toolbar or page header. Those are standalone menus: each trigger is its own `Tab` stop, looks like a separate button, and has none of the bar behavior below.

Each menu in the bar is a complete popup menu: invoker-triggered popover, nested focusgroup, submenus, separators, checkable items, positioning, pointer handling, and fallbacks. Build them as described in {{ GUIDE_REF("menu") }}; this guide covers only what the bar adds on top of each menu.

## Structure

* Put `role="menubar"` with an `aria-label` on the container of the top-level triggers, never on a popover. Each top-level trigger is a direct child of the menubar, immediately followed by its popover.
* Style the bar as one continuous strip with no gaps or borders between triggers. Visually separate buttons signal one `Tab` stop each; a continuous bar signals one widget.
* Give the trigger with `aria-expanded="true"` a visible active style so users can tell which menu is open or previewed.

```html
<div role="menubar" aria-label="Document commands">
  <!-- Only the active trigger is tabbable; the script moves tabindex with ArrowLeft and ArrowRight. -->
  <button id="file-trigger" type="button" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-expanded="false"
    commandfor="file-menu" command="toggle-popover">File</button>
  <div id="file-menu" popover="auto">
    <div focusgroup="menu nomemory" aria-labelledby="file-trigger">
      <!-- Items and submenus as in the menu guide -->
    </div>
  </div>

  <button id="edit-trigger" type="button" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-expanded="false"
    commandfor="edit-menu" command="toggle-popover" tabindex="-1">Edit</button>
  <div id="edit-menu" popover="auto">
    <div focusgroup="menu nomemory" aria-labelledby="edit-trigger">
      <!-- … -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Keyboard and focus

The menu guide's keyboard model applies inside every menu. The bar adds, on top of it:

* **One tab stop.** `Tab` enters at the first top-level trigger. `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` move between top-level triggers and wrap at either end. `Home` and `End` on a trigger enter its menu at the first or last item.
  * **Note: which trigger `Tab` returns to.** The APG allows either the first trigger or the last one used. The guide specifies the first, but moving the tab stop with `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` means that after keyboard navigation `Shift`+`Tab` returns to the last trigger reached. Pointer use does not move it, so the same sequence can land on a different trigger. Either behavior is acceptable; pick one and keep it consistent.
* **Preview.** Focusing a top-level trigger shows its menu and sets `aria-expanded="true"`. Focus stays on the trigger, and no item is focused. Blurring the trigger closes a preview-only menu.
* **Enter and Space on a preview.** They close the preview and keep focus on the trigger. The native `toggle-popover` action handles this, so the script must not intercept these keys.
* **ArrowDown on a preview.** Converts it to an open menu and focuses the first item.
* **ArrowLeft or ArrowRight in an open top-level menu.** Closes it and previews the adjacent menu with focus on its trigger, wrapping at either end. `ArrowDown` then enters it. Left and Right never land inside a menu.
* **ArrowRight on a submenu item without a child submenu.** Closes the hierarchy and previews the next top-level menu while focus stays on its trigger. `ArrowDown` then enters it.
* **Pointer over another top-level trigger while a menu is open.** Closes it and previews the hovered one, focusing its trigger without a ring. Nothing open: hover does nothing.
* **Tab.** Leaves the bar from a trigger or from inside any menu, closing every open menu.

## Implementing the bar

1. **Roving tabindex.** Set `tabindex="0"` on the first top-level trigger and `-1` on the rest. When `ArrowLeft` or `ArrowRight` moves to another trigger, move the `0` with it. Do not put the triggers in a focusgroup: the bar needs preview on focus and menu switching, which focusgroup does not provide.
2. **Preview on focus.** A top-level trigger's `focus` handler calls `menu.showPopover({ source: trigger })` so the menu anchors to it. Ignore focus returning from inside the trigger's own menu, or from another window (flag on window `blur`, cleared a tick after window `focus`, or app-switching reopens the last menu). Hide a previewed menu on `blur` unless focus moved into it.
3. **Moving between menus.** One function closes every open top-level menu, moves the tabindex, and focuses the target trigger; preview on focus does the rest. Call it from `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight` on a trigger, from the same keys inside an open top-level menu, and from `ArrowRight` on a submenu item with no child submenu.

```js
// Direct children only: submenu triggers live inside the bar's nested popovers.
const rootTriggers = [...document.querySelectorAll('[role="menubar"] > [commandfor]')];

// Left/Right always land on the adjacent trigger as a preview, never inside its menu, as in
// native menubars. ArrowDown then enters.
function moveToRootTrigger(from, direction) {
  const next = rootTriggers[(rootTriggers.indexOf(from) + direction + rootTriggers.length) % rootTriggers.length];
  rootTriggers.forEach(trigger => { trigger.tabIndex = trigger === next ? 0 : -1; });
  rootTriggers.map(menuFor).filter(isOpen).forEach(menu => menu.hidePopover());
  next.focus({ preventScroll: true }); // Focusing the trigger previews its menu.
}
```

4. **Hover switches open menus.** On `pointerenter` of a top-level trigger while another top-level menu is open: hide it, focus the hovered trigger without a ring (`focus({ focusVisible: false })`), and preview on focus previews it. Nothing open: do nothing. Keep `:hover` on top-level triggers: with nothing open it is plain button feedback, with a menu open the hover switches menus and focus follows.
5. **Entering from a trigger.** `ArrowDown` on a previewed trigger focuses the first item; on a closed trigger it marks the menu to be entered and calls `trigger.click()`, so the invoker stays the only open path. `Home` and `End` preview the menu if needed, then focus its first or last enabled item.
6. **Outside focus.** The `document` `focusin` listener that closes every menu must treat the menubar as inside the menu system, or `Tab` landing on a trigger closes the menu it just previewed.
7. **Instant switching.** Native menubars switch between open menus without animation. If menus animate, disable the transition while another menu in the bar is already open:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  /* Switching between open menubar menus is instant, as in native menubars. */
  [role="menubar"]:has(> [popover]:popover-open) > [popover] {
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

## Verify before finishing

An instruction cannot guarantee behavior, so test the result. Open the page and check each of these with the real keyboard and mouse; fix and re-test any that fail. Check the menus themselves against the menu guide's list.

* **One tab stop.** `Tab` lands on the first trigger once and previews its menu; `Shift`+`Tab` from the page content returns to the bar once, not to every trigger.
* **Arrow keys.** `ArrowRight` and `ArrowLeft` on a trigger preview the adjacent menu, wrapping, without focusing an item; `ArrowDown` enters; inside an open menu, `ArrowRight` and `ArrowLeft` switch to the adjacent menu as a preview.
* **Hover.** With File open, pointing at Edit switches to it instantly; with nothing open, pointing at a trigger does nothing.
* **Window focus.** Switching to another window and back does not reopen the last menu.
* **Leaving.** `Tab` from a trigger or from inside a menu closes everything and leaves the bar.

## Fallback strategies

The bar itself is roving tabindex, focus handling, and `showPopover()`, all widely supported script. The only addition beyond the menus is the `:has()` selector that disables the transition while switching; without it, switching animates like a plain open.

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("has") }}

The menus in the bar use focusgroup, popovers, invoker commands, and anchor positioning. Their fallbacks follow.
