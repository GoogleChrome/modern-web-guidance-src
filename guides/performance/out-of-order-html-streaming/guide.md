# Out-of-Order (OOO) HTML Streaming

Out-of-Order (OOO) HTML Streaming (also known as Declarative Partial Updates) is an alternative to the traditional "top-to-bottom" linear processing of HTML. It allows developers to define placeholders earlier in a document and "patch" them with content that arrives later in the same network stream, or via new imperative JavaScript streaming APIs.

## Quick Overview

The feature consists of two primary mechanisms:

1. **Declarative Patching (HTML-based)**: Uses new processing instructions (`<?marker>`, `<?start>`, `<?end>`) and `<template for>` to swap content in the DOM as it streams in from the server.
2. **Imperative setting and streaming (JS-based)**: A suite of new methods (e.g., `streamHTML()`, `setHTMLUnsafe()`) that allow setting of HTML or piping readable streams directly into DOM elements with native performance and optional script execution.

## Best Practices

* **Prioritize Above-the-Fold Content**: Stream critical UI (header, hero, primary navigation, primary content) first. Use placeholders for "expensive" or lower priority components like comments, ads, or related content.
* **Implement Native Loading States**: Use the `<?start>` and `<?end>` markers to wrap fallback content. The browser automatically replaces everything between these markers when the corresponding `<template for>` arrives.
* **Minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Always provide stable dimensions for placeholders. If the final content size is unknown, use skeleton screens or CSS `aspect-ratio` to reserve space and prevent jarring shifts.

## Accessibility Considerations

Be mindful that out-of-order updates can confuse screen reader users, people with cognitive impairments, and people who do not use a mouse or touch to interact with page content. In particular, make sure that focus is not lost if a placeholder containing the active element is replaced.

Additionally, and particularly when contents take a subjectively long time to stream, it may be necessary to provide text-based progress information, such as a "Loading..." notification, wrapped in a live region to prevent people from thinking that the page is "broken".

However, while it is tempting to inform them about every change to page content while it is being streamed, too many notifications can be disruptive and irritating, even when implemented with the best intentions. In particular:

* MANDATORY: Only apply the live region markup to the container for the text that indicates progress. Do not wrap the entire content in a live region, as this will cause screen readers to announce the full "patched" content when streaming is complete, which can overwhelm screen reader users.
* MANDATORY: Do not use `role="alert"` for conveying progress information. Some screen readers such as NVDA will announce the term "Alert" before announcing the live region text, which can be irritating for screen reader users, particularly when the related content doesn't represent an alert.

To decide on the best approach, be mindful of the type of content that is being streamed, and the types of components that are being populated by the streaming content.

For example, consider the following use cases.

1. **A dashboard-type user interface made up of several panels:** The content for each panel is opened in stages before the user can interact with the main content section as a whole, and - for some panels - it takes some time for some content to load, often up to a minute or more. Here, a live region-based notification is necessary. Apply the `aria-busy` attribute with a value of `true` to the container for the affected panels so that screen reader users are aware that the contents are not ready for interaction. This attribute should then be set to `false` when the streaming is complete.
   * MANDATORY: Do not nest the live region-based notification inside panels with `aria-busy="true"`, as this will prevent screen readers announcing the live region until after all of the content has been loaded.
   * MANDATORY: Focus must remain where it is while content is loading; it must not move to the content during the loading process or when loading is complete.
2. **A single page application:** An app is made up of a single HTML document. Rather than open a new page when a link is activated, the existing page content is automatically replaced with new content via streaming. Unless there is a delay due to the streaming content taking time to render, a live region-based notification is unnecessary. However, focus should move to the start of the new content when streaming is complete.
3. **A product page where content is streamed as the user scrolls the page:** When the page loads, the user is presented with a list of 10 products. As they scroll the page, additional products are added to the list via streaming. There is a short delay to allow the streaming content to load, during which time a "Loading additional products..." message is displayed and then replaced with the new content. Similarly to the first use case, this message should be wrapped in a live region, the `aria-busy` attribute should be applied to the container for the updating content (being reset to `aria-busy="false"` when the content is fully loaded), and focus should remain where it is and not move to the new content.
4. **A mega menu with a submenu whose content is rendered via streaming:** Whether the submenu content is streamed out-of-order while still collapsed or streamed almost immediately when expanded, it can be interacted with in the same way as if it weren't streamed. Here, the impact on screen reader users is negligible, so there is no need for a live region or any additional focus management.
5. **A profile widget that is added to the header after an API call is made to check the current status:** On initially loading the page, a "Login" link is displayed at the right-hand side of the header. If the user is already logged in, this is immediately replaced with a profile menu button. For such users, the change is barely noticeable. Like in the previous use case, there is no need to include a live region-based notification, nor should focus be moved to the new content.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Declarative HTML Markers

The browser looks for specific processing instructions to identify where content should be patched.

```html
<!-- A simple insertion point -->
<div id="sidebar">
  <?marker name="dynamic-comments">
</div>

<!-- A replacement range with loading state -->
<main>
  <?start name="main-content">
    <div class="skeleton" role="status">Loading main content...</div>
  <?end>
</main>

... (other content) ...

<!-- Later in the same stream, provide the content -->
<template for="dynamic-comments">
  <div class="comments">...</div>
</template>

<template for="main-content">
  <article>
    <h1>The Real Content</h1>
    <p>This replaces the skeleton div automatically.</p>
  </article>
</template>
```

Once a `<template>` replaces an insertion point, that insertion point no longer exists, and can not be reused. However, a `<template>` may contain insertion points that can be used later in the stream.

```html
 <?start name="replaced-content">
  <div class="skeleton">
<?end>
<!-- Later in the same stream, provide initial content -->
<template for="replaced-content">
  <?start name="replaced-content">
    <div>Quickly computed result</div>
  <?end>
</template>
<!-- Later in the same stream, provide full content -->
<template for="replaced-content">
  <?start name="replaced-content">
    <div>Full result</div>
  <?end>
</template>
```

### 2. Imperative JS Streaming

The browser provides a suite of 24 methods (6 actions, each with 4 variations) to update the DOM either statically (from a string) or via a stream.

#### API Reference Matrix

| Action | Static (Safe) | Streaming (Safe) | Static (Unsafe) | Streaming (Unsafe) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Set** | `setHTML()` | `streamHTML()` | `setHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Replace** | `replaceWithHTML()` | `streamReplaceWithHTML()` | `replaceWithHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamReplaceWithHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Before** | `beforeHTML()` | `streamBeforeHTML()` | `beforeHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamBeforeHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Prepend** | `prependHTML()` | `streamPrependHTML()` | `prependHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamPrependHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Append** | `appendHTML()` | `streamAppendHTML()` | `appendHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamAppendHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **After** | `afterHTML()` | `streamAfterHTML()` | `afterHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamAfterHTMLUnsafe()` |

#### Key Concepts

* **Safe vs. Unsafe**: 
  * **Safe** methods (e.g., `setHTML()`) use a built-in sanitizer by default to strip potentially dangerous content like `<script>` tags. You can pass a custom `Sanitizer` object in the options to apply in addition to the default sanitizer.
  * **Unsafe** methods (e.g., `setHTMLUnsafe()`) do not sanitize by default, but you can still pass a custom `Sanitizer`. To allow scripts to execute in the new content, you must explicitly pass `{ runScripts: true }` in the options. **IMPORTANT**: Only use unsafe methods with trusted content where safe methods would not work.
* **Static vs. Streaming**:
  * **Static** methods take a string (or `TrustedHTML`) and apply it immediately.
  * **Streaming** methods return a `WritableStream`. This allows you to pipe content (e.g., from a `fetch` response) directly into the DOM, and the browser will render it incrementally as chunks arrive.

#### Example: Streaming a Fetch Response

You can pipe fetch responses directly into the DOM without manual chunk handling.

```javascript
const main = document.querySelector('main');
const response = await fetch('/api/partial-update');

// Pipe the stream directly into the element
await response.body
  .pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())
  .pipeTo(main.streamHTMLUnsafe({ runScripts: true }));

// Or use the `textStream()` convenience method which streams directly without needing the intermediate `TextDecoderStream()` step
await response
  .textStream()
  .pipeTo(main.streamHTMLUnsafe({ runScripts: true }))
```

## Use Case Reference Matrix

* **Island Architecture**: Hydrate independent interactive components on top of static HTML without a full framework runtime.
* **Deferred "Expensive" Blocks**: Deliver the shell of a page immediately and stream database-heavy components as they become available.
* **Single Page Application (SPA) Updates**: Stream large UI transitions in SPAs using `streamHTML()` instead of waiting for a full JSON payload and manual DOM construction.

## Anti-Patterns & Warnings (DO NOT DO THIS)

* **Do not use OOO streaming for everything.** Over-fragmenting a page can increase the complexity of the stream and potentially delay content if the browser spends too much time patching small nodes.
* **Do not ignore Trusted Types.** When using `*Unsafe` methods in environments with Trusted Types enforced, ensure you are passing a sanitized policy object if required.
* **Do not assume script execution order.** Scripts inside a `<template for>` will execute as soon as they are patched into the document. Do not rely on them executing in a specific sequence relative to other deferred templates.
* **Do not use without a polyfill strategy.** Ensure you have a fallback or use polyfills (`html-setters-polyfill` and `template-for-polyfill`) to support your required browsers until this feature becomes Baseline.

## Fallback strategies

{{ BASELINE_STATUS("template-for") }}
{{ BASELINE_STATUS("html-setters") }}
{{ BASELINE_STATUS("html-streaming-setters") }}
{{ BASELINE_STATUS("html-processing-instructions") }}

You can use polyfills like `template-for-polyfill` and `html-setters-polyfill` to emulate the API surface for non-supporting browsers.

Browsers without `html-processing-instructions` support parse `<?marker>`, `<?start>`, and `<?end>` as comments. `template-for-polyfill` still recognizes these comments as markers, so keep the same processing instruction syntax for all browsers. Do not rewrite the markers as HTML comments or elements for non-supporting browsers.
